# GrowthWare

**GrowthWare** is a modular, multi-tenant open-source framework designed for rapid web application development with built-in role-based security, dynamic UI components, and a flexible architecture. Actively maintained as a personal development initiative, GrowthWare serves as both a working platform and a technical sandbox to stay current with evolving software frameworks and best practices.
